# Plan

Implementation plan for `ll-model`, re-sorted 2026-07-24 against the RFC
after the 2026-07-22 object-layout redesign landed in the `rfc` repo.

Design lives in `rfc` and is authoritative — read before coding, do not
re-derive: `model/classes.md`, `model/values.md`, `model/lowering.md`,
`model/gc/strategies.md`, `model/gc/satb.md`, `model/memory/ffi.md`,
`runtime/object-lifecycle.md`.

Updated: 2026-08-13 · Active: none — the sections below are the backlog

**Closed stages are deleted whole** (rule 23.1.3), and what outlived each
of them is in the journals rather than here: `dev/DECISIONS.md` for a
decision and its reason, `dev/POSTMORTEM.md` for a trap,
`dev/BENCHMARKS.md` for a measurement, `dev/INDEX.md` and
`dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the map. Deleted so far: S4 through S20, so no
stage is open. A number is never reissued, so a stage added later sits
where it is to be done rather than where its number falls, and the prose
sections below are the backlog stages are drawn from.

**`array::` has had its Miri run, in slices**, and the hour the module was
feared to cost was `array::entity`'s alone: `array::entry` took 4 seconds
over 7 tests and `array::table` 92 over 38, both clean, on 2026-08-13 at
`8d3728d`. A slice is still how the module is run — invocation and thread
cap in `dev/WORKFLOW.md`, Miri.

## Then: arrays as a performance problem

Opened 2026-08-07 at Edmond's request. What was representation work in it
is built — the generic element write, the strategy tag in the head, the
32-byte entry with its collision link inside the element Box, and the
2 → 3 migration — and the reasoning behind each is in `dev/DECISIONS.md`
(2026-08-07 for the entry, 2026-08-11 for the head). What is left is
measurement.

**Four constants stand on borrowed or invented numbers**: the string-key
check's reversal threshold, the compaction threshold taken from Zend at
about 3 %, and the flood ladder's two, `EQUAL_HASH_LIMIT` and
`CHAIN_LIMIT`. None of the four can be settled on this box —
`dev/BENCHMARKS.md` puts its noise floor at 1.5–3 %, and every effect in
question is smaller than that. So this is not a task waiting for someone
to pick it up: it waits for a machine that can resolve it, and measuring
here would produce a number indistinguishable from noise and harder to
retract than to publish.

## Beside the hashtable: the memory categories

Opened 2026-08-06, out of the same review chain, and independent of the
questions above. The routing item of that round is closed
(`memory/routing.rs`, and `dev/DECISIONS.md`); two are left, and the
second gates the first.

- [ ] **Rename the memory categories**, in the RFC where they are
  defined, through the documents that refer to them, and in the crate —
  **deferred 2026-08-06**, reasoning in `dev/DECISIONS.md`. `LongLived`
  is named after a duration rather than an owner, which is why its
  reclamation was never decided; `Region` would mark exactly the entities
  no region owns, a `#[Region]` class owning *arenas*; and `Arena` would
  make `arenas.md`'s "between two request arenas: forbidden" false before
  the mechanism justifying it exists. Meanwhile the category is marked
  out of use on the enum itself.
- [ ] **The region reset, and the refusal that waits on it.** The
  mechanism that would make a long-lived category mean something: what a
  region owns, when it resets, how the owner's O(1) death reaches its
  entities, and what promotion across a region boundary is.
  `rfc/model/memory/regions.md` is the starting point. It also gates
  `ll_string_new_dynamic`'s refusal of that category — today nothing
  would reclaim such a string. Blocked on design, not scheduled.

## What is left of the old phase lists

The A-chain of the 2026-07-24 status snapshot is finished but for two
items, and every rc-walk build step of Phase B is built, so both lists
were deleted with the snapshot that framed them. What survives is below,
each line verified against the code on 2026-08-13 rather than against its
own checkbox.

- [ ] **A3's factory half.** The descriptor carries `dispose`, and
  `ll_default_dispose` stands in until the compiler generates one.
  `factory` cannot be stood in for the same way: its signature is
  `factory(ctx, category)` with no class parameter, so it needs per-class
  generation, and the generic path stays
  `ll_object_new(ctx, class, category)`. `clone`, `deep_clone`,
  `thread_clone` and `thread_move` are reserved for the multi-threading
  future. "Only the GC reads `traced_runs` as data" holds once generated
  disposes replace the stand-in. `rfc/runtime/object-lifecycle.md`.
- [ ] **A7, no zeroing by default.** `ll_object_new` zero-fills the whole
  body unconditionally; which slots need a defined initial state is the
  factory's to decide (`rfc/BACKLOG.md`, deferred optimizations).
- [ ] **Kinds 4 and 6 have no producer.** `ll_entity_die`'s switch serves
  five; Box waits on the FFI surface and Lazy on the compiler, and each
  reaches a `debug_assert!` meanwhile. `Lazy` is nevertheless in
  `CANDIDATE_KINDS`, on the argument recorded in `dev/DECISIONS.md`,
  2026-08-07.
- [ ] **The collector's escalation ladder**, build order 5 of
  `rfc/model/gc/rc-walk.md`, and the trigger thresholds beside it. Both
  are gated on a starvation measurement that does not exist, which is why
  a collection is still an explicit call.
- [ ] **`rc-satb` as a second build-time GC strategy**
  (`rfc/model/gc/satb.md`). The `WRITING` bit it waited on is pinned and
  the barrier's hook site is reserved; nothing else of it is built.
- [ ] **Strategy 1, the typed vector.** No producer, so the 1 → 2
  transition waits on one — `dev/DECISIONS.md`, 2026-08-13, which also
  says what to confirm against `arrays.md` before opening it.
- [ ] **The rest of the language runtime**, listed in `rfc/BACKLOG.md`:
  exceptions, actors, closures, enums, generators and fibers, resources,
  generics, stdlib, I/O.
- [ ] **Phase D, the vertical slice** — hello-world through the whole
  stack, PHP to IR to executable, on the simplest memory setup. It
  validates the central bet, that the compiler can prove escape,
  monomorphism and ARC-pairing on real PHP, and it unblocks every
  calibration item below. It runs as a parallel track rather than in
  turn, because it waits on the unwritten execution-pipeline decisions
  (`rfc/BACKLOG.md`, "the big one") and on the C++/LLVM front end, both
  outside this crate.

## Residual / carried-over items

Owed to the array table by the map design, and owed before either map
class exists (`dev/DECISIONS.md`, 2026-08-13, "the flood ladder gets
kind-dispatched triggers"; `rfc/model/maps.md`, "What the flood ladder
becomes"):

- [ ] **The per-process key**, new work in `src/hash`: 32 bytes from the
  OS once per process in every build, outside `STAMP` and exempt from
  `hash-folding`, because nothing compiled may depend on it.
  `strong_hash`'s doc names the slot and stands in for it. Everything
  below waits on it, and so does `MapMixed`, whose key identity cannot be
  defined without it.
- [ ] **The ladder's repair in `array/table.rs`**: the equal-identity
  trigger becomes a tag-equality test rather than "not an integer key";
  `slot_hash` and `entry_slot_hash` dispatch on the tag with the
  byte-hashing branch asserted unreachable from any other; `draw_salt`
  draws under the per-process key instead of hashing a recyclable address
  under a foldable seed; `strong_hash` becomes the keyed function its own
  doc promises; and rung three, a refusal distinguishable from an
  allocation refusal, replaces the early returns that today make a spent
  ladder a dead one.
- [ ] **The key word's tag**, also `array/table.rs` and `array/entry.rs`,
  because the trigger above presupposes it: one encoding of the key field
  for every owner, the readers listed in `rfc/model/maps.md` under "The
  key word gains a tag, for every owner".

Memory manager, still open:

- [ ] **Batch the cross-thread free, once a workload exists** — gated on
  measurement, and the gate comes first. Today `Heap::free_remote` posts
  each foreign slot with its own CAS onto the owning block's
  `remote_free` stack, and `buffer_arena::post_remote` does the same for
  a chunk, so the cost is linear in items freed. snmalloc gathers the
  same work into one message queue per owning allocator and pays one
  atomic operation per batch instead (`dev/RESEARCH.md`, 2026-08-08).

  The shape, if it is ever wanted: stage foreign frees in a bounded
  thread-local buffer with no atomics, group them by block on flush —
  `ptr & !BLOCK_MASK`, one AND, and a 64 KiB block holds thousands of
  slots, so a batch lands in a handful of blocks — link each group into a
  chain through the dead slots themselves, and CAS each chain onto its
  block's head once. No per-object memory: the links live in the freed
  slots, as they do now. The staging buffer is the only new memory, one
  fixed-size array per thread.

  What it costs is not memory but **return latency**: freed memory
  reaches its owner a batch late, so peak RSS rises by the batch, which
  is a real change of behaviour in a runtime whose ordinary free is
  immediate. A thread exiting with a staged batch must flush it or leak
  it; `deferred_free::dispose` is the existing shape for that.

  Removing the atomic entirely means a per-thread-pair SPSC ring
  (`ck_ring`), which costs memory per pair. That is the trade snmalloc
  declines, and so should we.

  **Why not now.** Our CAS is already spread across blocks, which is
  mimalloc's contention argument, so the win would be in the count of
  atomic operations and not in contention. Nothing today drives the path:
  the crate is single-mutator, and the callers are one test group
  (`heap::tests::frees_arriving_from_another_thread`) plus whatever
  reaches the raw C ABI from another thread. Order: a program that frees
  another thread's objects in bulk, then a measurement, then this.

- [ ] Buffer *K* and memory-pressure mode thresholds — **blocked on D**:
  they need real workloads, and designing them further on paper is what
  the block is for (`rfc/model/memory/buffers.md`).
- [ ] Per-block dense/sparse reset threshold calibration — **blocked on
  D** for the same reason (`rfc/model/memory/arena-reset.md`).

Read from rpmalloc 2.0.1 on 2026-08-10 (`dev/RESEARCH.md`). Material to
think with, not decisions: none of it is measured here, and each entry
names what would have to be measured first.

- [ ] **Reallocate in place when the class does not change.**
  `stdapi::ll_realloc` allocates, copies and frees on every call, so 40
  bytes to 48 costs a block, a `memcpy` and a free to move inside one
  48-byte slot. `stdapi::ll_usable_size` already reads the class size out
  of the block header, so the test is one comparison on a path that is
  cold anyway. rpmalloc also declines to move a huge block that shrinks
  by less than half, and overallocates to 1.375x on a small growth so
  that a loop growing a few bytes at a time stops reallocating at every
  step (`rpmalloc.c:2402`, `2413`, `2429`).
  **What comes first:** a harness. `rptest` in `benches/standard.rs`
  frees and allocates rather than reallocating, so this path has no
  measurement at all, and nothing in the runtime calls it either — it
  serves the raw C surface.

- [ ] **Size classes for the band between 8 KiB and one block.** Classes
  stop at `heap::MAX_SMALL` and everything above takes a whole 64 KiB
  block, so a 9 KiB request holds 64 KiB. Five classes divide the
  65280-byte payload without a tail — 10880, 13056, 16320, 21760 and
  32640, at six slots down to two — and hold the worst case to 1.33x at
  the bottom of the band and 1.5x at the top; past 32 KiB one object per
  block is already the two-times ceiling. The fast path need not move:
  `ll_alloc` routes anything past `MAX_SMALL` into a cold function, and
  the class is chosen there by a short comparison chain, so `CLASS_LUT`
  stays 514 entries instead of growing to 4082. Free simplifies, since
  these become ordinary heap blocks that the existing `BLOCK_KIND_HEAP`
  arm serves.
  **What it costs:** five more classes in three per-heap arrays and in
  the abandoned table, about 120 bytes per thread, and a high block
  switch rate on a two-slot class — against today's pool get and put per
  object, which is worse in every case. The routing list at the head of
  `stdapi.rs` and `docs/memory-manager.md` move with the change.
  **What comes first:** a footprint measurement, and there is none:
  `benches/alloc.rs` stops at 8192. The metric is `blocks_out` and RSS
  rather than operations per second.
  **Settle separately:** entities past 8 KiB take the same path and live
  outside the walk on purpose; a uniform stride would make them walkable,
  which `rfc/model/gc/rc-walk.md` decided the other way.

- [ ] **A flag saying the block already reads zero.** `Heap::refill`
  writes eight bytes into every slot of an entity block unconditionally —
  up to 4080 stores at the 16-byte class, and at a 16-byte stride that
  dirties every line of the 64 KiB block. The invariant is narrower than
  the pass: the walker reads only slots below `bump` and tests one field.
  Two sources of the same knowledge exist and neither is used. A region
  taken with `alloc_zeroed` instead of `alloc` is untouched kernel
  memory. A block returned empty from an entity heap already satisfies
  the invariant, because `FreeSlot` preserves the dead entity's final
  header and an entity dies at refcount 0. What breaks it is a block that
  served as raw or arena memory in between, or a recommissioning at a
  different stride, so the flag has to name the stride it holds for.
  **What comes first:** the case that shows the cost. Amortised over the
  steady-state benchmarks it is small, refill running about 0.00003 times
  per allocation; the workload to measure is a growing one, where the
  pass is one extra store per object created.

- [ ] **Return memory to the OS, and cache huge mappings** — blocked on
  the prerequisite the head of `stdapi.rs` already names: regions come
  from `std::alloc::alloc`, not from mmap. rpmalloc lets free pages
  accumulate to 16, 8, 4 or 2 per page type and then decommits down to 4,
  2, 1 or 1, keeping the header prefix committed (`rpmalloc.c:712`,
  `2003`, `1249`), and sends a freed huge mapping to a 32-slot cache
  bounded by committed bytes and evicted by age rather than straight back
  to the OS (`rpmalloc.c:1600`). Ours never come back, and `LARGE_RUN`
  unmaps on every free. Either way the block header line stays committed:
  the walker reads every block's kind across the region.

Object model, deferred by design:

- [ ] General interception Proxy — transparent method interception on an
  existing target without touching its class; prerequisite for
  proxy-mediated movability. Needs a mechanism discussion.
- [ ] Binary-level class interceptors (vtable-slot patching) — check
  whether this is the same mechanism as the deferred CHA-style optimistic
  devirtualization (`rfc/model/classes.md`, Deferred).
- [ ] Allocation telemetry layer 2 / debug mode — full design in
  `dev/design/debug-modes.md`, and the build order is its section 10.
  Item 1 of that order, the event journal, is built; the rest of the
  section is unscheduled.

## Cross-cutting (every phase)

- Correctness tests per the project style (`test_guard`, scenario-per-test)
  and criterion benchmarks per `dev/BENCHMARKS.md` — follow the protocol,
  do not improvise. Benches do not cross the C ABI; ABI-entry work is shown
  by IR/asm.
- `dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the crate's knowledge map: layers and their
  sanctioned edges, the per-module "does not know" table, the header-bit
  ledger, the five end-to-end paths. Written; it moves with behaviour
  like any other document (`dev/WORKFLOW.md`).
